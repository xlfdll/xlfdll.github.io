    <h1><strong>Privacy Policy (Fkulc's Password Generator)</strong></h1>
    <p>
        Xlfdll built the Fkulc's Password Generator app as
        an Open Source app. This SERVICE is provided by
        Xlfdll at no cost and is intended for use as
        is.
    </p>
    <p>
        This page is used to inform visitors regarding my
        policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal
        Information if anyone decided to use my Service.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to
        the collection and use of information in relation to this
        policy. The Personal Information that I collect is
        used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with
        anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p>
    <p>
        While using our Service, I do not require you to provide any personally
        identifiable information. All the information that is requested by the app
        will be retained on your device and is not collected by me in any way.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Camera</strong></p>
    <p>
        Our Service contains features that require user's consent of camera usage.
        It is solely designed for reading QR code (an image contains a small piece of information)
        that is generated by our Service only for settings exchanging purpose.
        Our Service will not collect any personal identifiable information through images
        captured by the camera.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Log Data</strong></p>
    <p>
        I want to inform you that whenever you
        use my Service, in a case of an error in the app
        I collect data and information (through third-party
        products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may
        include information such as your device Internet Protocol
        (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the
        configuration of the app when utilizing my Service,
        the time and date of your use of the Service, and other
        statistics.
    </p>
    <p>
        All the above information will be used solely for app troubleshooting,
        debugging, and development purposes. After such activities completed,
        such information will be erased completely. Such information will not be
        disclosed to any third parties.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
    <p>
        Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are
        commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent
        to your browser from the websites that you visit and are
        stored on your device's internal memory.
    </p>
    <p>
        This Service does not collect or use these “cookies” in any way.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
    <p>
        The Service does not have any online features except Log Data described above.
        Thus, the Service does not transmit any personal identifiable information.
        But remember that no method
        of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic
        storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot
        guarantee its absolute security.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Children's Privacy</strong></p> <!---->
    <div>
        <p>
            I do not knowingly collect personally
            identifiable information from children, and the Service does not have any features that collect or transmit such information.
            I encourage all children to never type or submit any personally
            identifiable information through
            the Application and/or Services.
            I encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor
            their children's Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing
            their children never to provide personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services
            without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child
            has provided personally identifiable information to us through the Application and/or Services,
            please contact us. You must also be at least 16 years of age to consent to the processing
            of your personally identifiable information in your country (in some countries we may allow your parent
            or guardian to do so on your behalf).
        </p>
    </div>
